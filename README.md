Our project aims to educate users about how their physical data is collected, used, and shared in Virtual Environments (VEs). To overcome the traditional privacy policy settings, we introduce a system featuring policy-guided VR rooms where it interacts with users to inform privacy policy in a more intuitive manner. We plan to create a mirror-like avatar that mimics user behaviors to visualize the movement for demonstrating what data is collected and how it is used. To implement this, we have developing three key features: **facial expression**, **hand tracking**, and **eye tracking**. These features can be integrated into a single avatar later or added and removed modularly, depending on the type of tracking feature an VR application collects. Below are screenshots of each implemented tracking feature.
